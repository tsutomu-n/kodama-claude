- **Smart Context Management** - Intelligent features to reduce cognitive load for junior developers
  - 5-decision limit: Shows only the latest 5 decisions by default (configurable via `KODAMA_NO_LIMIT`)
  - Auto-archive: Automatically moves snapshots older than 30 days to `archive/` directory (configurable via `KODAMA_AUTO_ARCHIVE`)

- **Internationalization (i18n)** - Multi-language support
  - Japanese error messages and prompts (via `KODAMA_LANG=ja`)
  - Automatic language detection from system locale

## [0.1.0] - 2024-08-09

### Added
- Initial release of KODAMA Claude
- Core commands: `kc go`, `kc snap`, `kc send`, `kc plan`, `kc doctor`
- Atomic file operations with fsync for data integrity
- XDG Base Directory specification compliance
- Multi-level clipboard fallback (OSC52, system clipboard, temp files)
- Schema validation with Zod
- Git integration for context tracking
- Binary distribution via Bun compile
- One-liner installation script
- Comprehensive test suite
- GitHub Actions workflow for automated releases

### Design Principles
- "Less is more" - Minimal feature set focused on core functionality
- Junior developer first - 30-second learning curve
- Single binary distribution - No runtime dependencies for core features
- Fail gracefully - Multiple fallback strategies for every operation

### Technical Stack
- TypeScript for type safety
- Bun runtime for performance and single-binary compilation
- Commander.js for CLI interface
- Zod for schema validation
