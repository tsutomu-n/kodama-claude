## Future Development Plans

### v0.5.0 - Snapshot Management Suite (Planned)

**Target Release**: Q1 2025  
**Theme**: Complete snapshot lifecycle management

#### Priority 1: Core Management Commands

**1. `kc show <id>` - Display Specific Snapshot**
```bash
# Show full details of a snapshot
kc show abc123

# Output format:
# ==========================================
# Snapshot: abc123def456
# Title: Implemented user authentication
# Created: 2025-08-13 14:30:00
# Step: testing
# Tags: auth, backend
# ==========================================
# Context:
# - Added JWT token validation
# - Implemented refresh token logic
# - Created test suite
# 
# Decisions:
# - Use 30-minute token expiry
# - Store refresh tokens in httpOnly cookies
# 
# Next Steps:
# - Add password reset functionality
# - Implement 2FA
```

**2. `kc delete <id>` - Remove Snapshots**
```bash
# Delete single snapshot
kc delete abc123

# Delete multiple (with confirmation)
kc delete abc123 def456 ghi789

# Delete by age
kc delete --older-than "30 days"

# Delete by pattern (with confirmation)
kc delete --match "test-*"
```

**3. `kc search <query>` - Full-Text Search**
```bash
# Search in titles
kc search "authentication"

# Search in all fields
kc search --all "JWT token"

# Search with filters
kc search --tag backend "database"

# Regex search
kc search --regex "fix.*bug"
```

#### Priority 2: Advanced Filtering for `kc list`

**Enhanced List Options**
```bash
# Time-based filtering
kc list --since "2 days ago"
kc list --since "2025-08-10"
kc list --today
kc list --yesterday
kc list --this-week

# Tag filtering
kc list --tag auth
kc list --tags auth,backend  # Multiple tags (AND)
kc list --any-tag auth,frontend  # Multiple tags (OR)

# Step filtering
kc list --step testing
kc list --step done

# Combined filters
kc list --tag backend --since yesterday --step testing
```

#### Priority 3: Export/Import Functionality

**1. `kc export` - Backup Snapshots**
```bash
# Export all snapshots
kc export --output backup.tar.gz

# Export specific date range
kc export --since "2025-08-01" --output august-backup.tar.gz

# Export as JSON for processing
kc export --format json --output snapshots.json

# Export with tags
kc export --tag important --output important-work.tar.gz
```

**2. `kc import` - Restore Snapshots**
```bash
# Import from backup
kc import backup.tar.gz

# Import with merge (skip duplicates)
kc import --merge another-backup.tar.gz

# Import with prefix (for organization)
kc import --prefix "old-project-" legacy-backup.tar.gz
```

### v0.6.0 - Collaboration Features (Future)

**Theme**: Team workflow support

1. **Snapshot Sharing**
   - `kc share <id>` - Generate shareable link
   - `kc pull <url>` - Import shared snapshot

2. **Cloud Sync**
   - `kc sync init` - Setup GitHub Gist sync
   - `kc sync push` - Upload snapshots
   - `kc sync pull` - Download snapshots

3. **Team Templates**
   - `kc template save` - Save as template
   - `kc template use` - Apply template

### v0.7.0 - Intelligence Layer (Future)

**Theme**: Smart assistance

1. **Auto-tagging**
   - Automatic tag suggestions based on content
   - Machine learning-based categorization

2. **Smart Search**
   - Semantic search capabilities
   - Similar snapshot recommendations

3. **Workflow Automation**
   - Custom hooks for events
   - Scheduled snapshots
   - Auto-cleanup policies

## Technical Considerations

### Architecture Decisions for v0.5.0

1. **Search Implementation**
   - Use SQLite FTS5 for full-text search
   - Maintain backward compatibility with JSON storage
   - Create index on first search (lazy indexing)

2. **Delete Safety**
   - Always require confirmation for destructive operations
   - Implement soft delete with 7-day recovery window
   - Create `.trash/` directory for deleted snapshots

3. **Export Format**
   - Use tar.gz for full backups (preserves timestamps)
   - Support JSON for interoperability
   - Include version metadata for future compatibility

### Performance Goals

- `kc list`: < 100ms for 1000 snapshots
- `kc search`: < 200ms for full-text search
- `kc show`: < 50ms for single snapshot
- `kc delete`: < 100ms with confirmation

### Security Requirements

- Path traversal protection in all file operations
- Input validation for all commands
- Safe deletion with recovery option
- Encrypted export option for sensitive data
- No arbitrary code execution in templates

## Development Principles

1. **Backward Compatibility**
   - Never break existing snapshots
   - Maintain v0.3.0+ compatibility
   - Graceful migration paths

2. **User Safety**
   - Confirmation for destructive operations
   - Undo/recovery mechanisms
   - Clear error messages

3. **Performance**
   - Lazy loading where possible
   - Efficient indexing strategies
   - Memory-conscious operations

4. **Simplicity**
   - Intuitive command structure
   - Consistent UI/UX patterns
   - Minimal configuration

## Testing Strategy

### For Each New Feature
1. Unit tests (minimum 80% coverage)
2. Integration tests with real snapshots
3. Performance benchmarks
4. Security audit checklist
5. Documentation updates
6. User acceptance testing
